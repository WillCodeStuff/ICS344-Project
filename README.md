# Work Distribution:
We decided to work in parallel, making sure all of the group members start the phase and finish with each other, sharing our notes and findings.
The purpose of this is to enhance our skills in all parts, from discovering, attacking, analyzing and implementing a defense strategy.

## Note:
Within each of the folders above, you will find the screenshots used in each phase. In addition, you will find file called:
Phase#.PDF which includes the pages of the phase from the main report. Furthermore, a full copy of the report is in the main
page.
